                        <p> Coding is hard. People are soft.</p>
                        <p> This app helps you use people to make coding less hard. </p>
                        <p> Thanks to all our hard work, you can now view github projects 
                            that people would like help with. Our innovative app shows you their project name, 
                            a nice description about what it is, and their tech stack in a sweet, sweet doughnut chart.</p>
